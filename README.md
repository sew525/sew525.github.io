# Biography
**I am a double minor in marketing and theatre** I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and my cat, Bella.

I live in Honolulu, Hawaii and will graduate from Lehigh in 2025. I plan to work in PR and communications, ideally for the Walt Disney company. Because of this, I want to complete the Disney College Program or study abroad.
