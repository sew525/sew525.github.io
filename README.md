# Biography
**I am a double minor in marketing and theatre.** I will graduate from Lehigh in 2025. I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and my cat, Bella.

I am from Honolulu, Hawaii. My passions are communications, specifically being an ambassador to institutions, businesses, and establishments I care about. I am first a foremost an extrovert: I am driven by others and care deeply about the people I love. They inspire me everyday. Since I study so far from my family, it is always my goal to make them proud. My friends and family are my rock and make up who I am.

This is an infographic made in Canva to show a small breakdown of the student enrollment in 2021 in Lehigh. The [data](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf) was gathered from the Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics.
