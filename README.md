# Biography
**I am a double minor in marketing and theatre.** I will graduate from Lehigh in 2025. I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, and my cat, Bella.

I am from Honolulu, Hawaii. My passions are communications, specifically being an ambassador to institutions, businesses, and establishments I care about. I am first a foremost an extrovert: I am driven by others and care deeply about the people I love. They inspire me everyday. Since I study so far from my family, it is always my goal to make them proud. My friends and family are my rock and make up who I am.

# Lehigh Student Enrollment

Here is my project on [**Lehigh's Student Enrollment.**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFM99eWsik/nr0jSlfYoutNs-Fazm57OA/view?utm_content=DAFM99eWsik&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu)
This is an infographic made in Canva to show a small breakdown of the student enrollment in 2021 in Lehigh. The [data](https://oirsa.lehigh.edu/sites/oirsa.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2021.pdf) was gathered from the Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics.

# Hawaii Tourism Statistics

Here is an infographic for [Hawaii Tourism in July 2022.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFNQlDk_SY/xIo89PaTs2bGlffFy0_2uw/view?utm_content=DAFNQlDk_SY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=homepage_design_menu)
I was inspired to base this project off Hawaii tourism because that is where I am from and also tourism affects Hawaii residents more than the general population is aware. The [data](https://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/media/9747/july-2022-visitor-statistic-press-release.pdf) was gathered from the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The HTA releases the [monthly tourism statistics](https://www.hawaiitourismauthority.org/research/monthly-visitor-statistics/) after the month passes and data becomes available.
